# Project Structure

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Analyzing and Predicting Solar Activity" project. The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data**:
   - `SN_y_tot_V2.0.csv`: The dataset containing sunspot numbers (`ssn`), standard deviation (`sd`), number of observations (`n_obs`), deficit in observations (`def`), and year (`year`).

2. **Notebooks**:
   - `01_Data_Exploration.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for initial data exploration and descriptive statistics.
   - `02_Trend_Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for trend analysis using linear regression.
   - `03_Solar_Cycle_Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for identifying solar cycles and analyzing cycle lengths and amplitudes.
   - `04_Correlation_Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for exploring correlations between variables.
   - `05_Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for Fourier Transform analysis and time series forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM models.
   - `06_Machine_Learning_Techniques.ipynb`: Notebook for applying machine learning techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering.
   - `07_Solar_Irradiance_Estimation.ipynb`: Notebook for estimating solar irradiance variations based on sunspot numbers.

3. **Scripts**:
   - `utils.py`: Utility functions used across multiple notebooks.
   - `forecasting_models.py`: Python script containing functions for time series forecasting models (ARIMA and LSTM).
   - `machine_learning_models.py`: Python script containing functions for regression, classification, and clustering models.

4. **Reports**:
   - `Final_Report.pdf`: PDF document containing the detailed analysis, results, conclusions, and future work of the project.

5. **Environment**:
   - `requirements.txt`: Text file listing the Python packages and versions required to run the code in this project. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

6. **README.md**:
   - Markdown file containing project overview, structure, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

7. **License**:
   - `LICENSE`: License file specifying the terms of use for the project.

8. **Documentation**:
   - Any additional documentation or resources related to the project.
